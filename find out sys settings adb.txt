To find out name of some system setting you can use this technique:

Export all settings from the device:

adb shell settings list global > global_before.txt 
adb shell settings list system > system_before.txt 
adb shell settings list secure > secure_before.txt

Change the wanted setting in Settings application

Export all settings from the device again:

adb shell settings list global > global_after.txt 
adb shell settings list system > system_after.txt 
adb shell settings list secure > secure_after.txt

Compare the before/after files and the single change you will find will be your setting.

adb shell "su -c settings put secure 'sleep_timeout' '-1'"
adb shell "su -c settings get secure 'sleep_timeout'"


adb shell "su -c settings put system 'nearby_scanning_enabled' '0'"
